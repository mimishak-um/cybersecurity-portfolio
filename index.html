                <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>My journey in cybersecurity began with a foundational interest in networking and programming, which evolved into a full-fledged career in Cybersecurity. 
                    <br><br>This foundation allowed me to build a strong technical base, starting with certifications such as Cisco CCNA & CompTIA Security+, which deepened my understanding of networking and security fundamentals. Progressing further, I pursued certifications like Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate & ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) to strengthen my expertise in Cloud security and cybersecurity management. 
                    <br><br>Alongside my cybersecurity journey, I am also a passionate web developer with proficiency in PHP, JavaScript, and HTML, which has enhanced my problem-solving capabilities and technical versatility. These skills have enabled me to develop secure web applications, identify vulnerabilities, and implement effective remediation strategies.
                    <br><br>Over the years, I have developed advanced skills in SIEM management, threat hunting, and automation, applying these to solve real-world security challenges. My hands-on experience includes working with Stellar Cyber, Splunk, and other SIEM tools to detect and respond to threats efficiently. Additionally, I have implemented SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) solutions, significantly improving incident response times and reducing alert fatigue.
                    <br><br>To stay current in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity, I regularly engage in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, online cybersecurity labs, and industry conferences. I also explore emerging technologies like AI in cybersecurity and their integration into existing defense mechanisms.
                    <br><br>My passion for continuous learning and growth drives me to mentor others, share knowledge, and contribute to building resilient security operations. This commitment has shaped not only my career but also my broader perspective on the importance of cybersecurity in a digital-first world.</p>
